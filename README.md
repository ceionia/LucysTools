More coming soon!
Probably certainly full of bugs.

Compatibility:
- Works *only* with WEBFISHING 1.10
- I haven't tested any other mods with this, but I'm happy to try to make things compatible, submit a bug report with the incompatible mod! (Only mods that have source available)

Bugs:
- Make sure your versions of LucysTools & LucysLib are the latest release before submitting bug reports, please.
