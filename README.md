LucysTools
----------
Uses GDWeave.

- Makes the client (tunably) read all packets. This fixes chat messages dropping.
- Lets you set a custom server name and message that will be sent when someone joins.
- Lets you spawn rainclouds & meteors.
- Lets you do 'raw' messages & BBCode in messages.
- Optionally knocks people back when they punch you.
- More coming soon!
- Probably certainly full of bugs.

Packet options:
- 'Per Frame Packets' is the number of net packets your client will attempt to read per frame. 
- 'Bulk Read Packets' is the number of net packets your client will attempt to read per 'Bulk Read Interval' (in seconds)
- 'Full Read Interval' is how often your client will attempt to read *all* net packets (in seconds).

Compatibility:
- Works *only* with WEBFISHING 1.08
- I haven't tested any other mods with this, but I'm happy to try to make things compatible, submit a bug report with the incompatible mod! (Only mods that have source available)

Bugs:
- Make sure your version of LucysTools is the latest release before submitting bug reports, please.
